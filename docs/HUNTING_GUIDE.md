- **Large Game**: Bears, elk, bison ‚Üí Safety-first positioning and distraction
- **Predators**: Wolves, cougars ‚Üí Defensive hunting with escape routes

## ü¶å Hunting Strategies by Game Type

### **Small Game Hunting (Rabbits, Squirrels, Birds)**

**How It Works:**
1. **Approach hunting area** with companion active
2. **Draw small game weapon** (bow, small rifle)
3. **Companion automatically enters stealth mode**
4. **Aim at small game** - hunt prompt appears
5. **Use prompt** - companion coordinates positioning
6. **Take shot** when companion has optimally positioned prey
7. **Companion automatically retrieves** downed game

**AI Behavior:**
- **Silent movement** - companion moves quietly to avoid spooking prey
- **Scent tracking** - follows animal trails and burrows
- **Positioning** - drives game toward clear shooting lanes
- **Quick retrieval** - immediately fetches small game after shots

**Best Times:**
- **Early morning** (5-7 AM game time) for highest success
- **Dense cover areas** where cats excel
- **Multiple small companions** can cover more ground

### **Medium Game Hunting (Deer, Boar, Coyotes)**

**How It Works:**
1. **Scout area** - companion automatically detects herds/trails
2. **Position strategically** - AI suggests optimal approach angles
3. **Use terrain** - companion helps guide game to open areas
4. **Coordinate shot timing** - companion creates opportunities
5. **Pack hunting** - multiple companions automatically coordinate

**Advanced AI Techniques:**
- **Drive hunting**: Companion slowly pushes game toward hunter
- **Ambush setup**: AI positions companion to block escape routes
- **Scent masking**: Well-trained companions help mask human scent
- **Herd separation**: Isolate individual animals from groups

**Environmental Factors:**
- **Wind direction**: AI automatically positions companions downwind
- **Cover usage**: Companions use natural concealment
- **Noise discipline**: Coordinated quiet movement
- **Distance management**: Maintains optimal positioning ranges

### **Large Game Hunting (Bears, Elk, Bison)**

**How It Works:**
1. **Safety assessment** - AI evaluates threat level automatically
2. **Defensive positioning** - companion maintains safe distance initially
3. **Distraction tactics** - companion diverts attention when safe
4. **Flanking support** - positions for optimal shot angles
5. **Emergency response** - companion assists if hunter threatened

**Critical Safety Protocols:**
- **Never direct attack** - AI prevents companion from directly engaging large predators
- **Defensive stance** - companion protects hunter from charges
- **Escape route planning** - AI maintains exit strategies
- **Medical preparedness** - companion carries emergency supplies

**AI Safety Features:**
- **Threat assessment** - continuous evaluation of danger levels
- **Distance management** - maintains safe engagement ranges
- **Emergency signals** - companion alerts to immediate dangers
- **Protective positioning** - shields hunter from aggressive wildlife
