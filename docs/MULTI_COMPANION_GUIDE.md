# üë• HDRP-Companion Multi-Companion Management Guide

Complete guide for managing multiple active companions simultaneously in RedM.

## üéØ Multi-Companion Overview

The HDRP-Companion system supports up to 3-5 active companions simultaneously (server configurable). This advanced feature allows for complex pack dynamics, specialized role assignments, and coordinated group activities that single companions cannot achieve.

## üêï Understanding Pack Dynamics

### **üèõÔ∏è Pack Hierarchy System**
The system automatically establishes a pack hierarchy based on:
- **Experience Level**: Higher level companions naturally become leaders
- **Bonding Strength**: Stronger player bonds increase leadership potential
- **Personality Types**: Aggressive and Loyal companions tend to lead
- **Activity History**: Companions with more field experience gain authority
- **Training Specialization**: Specialized skills affect pack position

### **üëë Alpha Companion (Pack Leader)**
**Selection Criteria**:
- Highest combination of level + bonding + experience
- Automatically designated when multiple companions are active
- Can be manually assigned through advanced commands

**Leadership Responsibilities**:
- Coordinates group movement and positioning
- Makes tactical decisions during activities
- Mediates conflicts between pack members
- Sets the pace for group activities
- Protects weaker pack members

**Visual Indicators**:
- Subtle golden glow around collar/nameplate
- Confident body language and positioning
- Other companions defer to alpha's decisions
