# üîç HDRP-Companion Tracking Guide

Complete guide for tracking and following mechanics with your companions in RedM.

## üêæ Tracking Overview

Tracking is an automatic AI capability that activates through context-aware prompts and intelligent companion behavior. Your companion uses advanced scent detection, visual observation, and environmental analysis to follow trails and locate targets.

## üéØ How Tracking Works

### **ü§ñ Automatic Tracking Activation**
The tracking system activates when:
1. **Near animal tracks** or scent trails with companion present
2. **Aiming at targets** you want companion to follow
3. **In areas with recent activity** that companion can detect
4. **Context suggests tracking** (investigation, hunting, search scenarios)

### **üéÆ Prompt-Based Interaction**
**Available Tracking Prompts:**
- **Track Target**: Appears when aiming at animals, players, or objects
- **Follow Trail**: Appears near fresh scent trails or tracks
- **Search Area**: Appears in locations with detectable activity

### **üß† AI Context Analysis**
**Your companion automatically analyzes:**
- **Scent strength and age** of trails (fresh, hours old, days old)
- **Trail type identification** (human, animal, specific species)
- **Environmental factors** (weather, terrain, obstacles)
- **Safety assessment** (threat level, escape routes)

2. **Follow Trail prompt appears** near detectable trails
3. **Companion enters tracking mode** automatically
4. **Trail quality assessment** shown through companion behavior

**Trail Quality Indicators:**
- **Fresh trails** (under 30 minutes): Confident, fast movement
- **Recent trails** (1-2 hours): Methodical, steady progress  
- **Old trails** (hours to days): Careful, slow confirmation

### **üåç Area Search Tracking**
**Automatic Activation:**
1. **Enter areas with unknown activity** patterns
2. **Companion detects potential tracking opportunities**
